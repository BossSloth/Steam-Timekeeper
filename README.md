### Steps on how to set up the project

> It is recommended to put the plugin repository in your Steam plugins folder or make some symbolic links to the
> repository for easier development.

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/BossSloth/Steam-timekeeper.git`
2. Run `bun install` or use your favorite package manager
3. Now you can run `bun watch` or `bun dev` to build the plugin and watch for changes

> Note: `bun dev` will only watch for changes in the webkit and frontend folder and the scss file, to reload the plugin just press `F5` in the steam client to reload
> For changes to the backend, you will need to fully restart the Steam client.
